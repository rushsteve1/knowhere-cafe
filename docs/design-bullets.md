# Design Bullets

These are in no order and make no sense but are to remind me for later triage

* Email based forums
  * I am terrified of having to deal with Email
* In Go, try to keep to stdlib
* Posts in hierarchy
* RSS and JSONFeed support
* Minimal JS, just Triptych (or htmx)
* Email submissions and subscription
* Digest emails
* Supports just PostgreSQL with Gorm
* Configured with Env vars
* Passwordless using passkeys and magic links
  * https://passkeys.dev/docs/use-cases/bootstrapping/
* Attempt to merge to Email UX and forums UX
* Light and dark themes
* Account management through email
* Markdown or similar rendering
* Account permission tiers
* Invite tree
* Posting limits
* Configured in database
* Webmention support
* Fediverse support (external read only)
* Structured search (SQL w/ perm?)
  * maybe as some kind of saved view that gets periodically refreshed
  * https://github.com/expr-lang/expr
* Some kind of draft or "incomplete message" system

## Inspirations

* Email
* OLD Reddit
* Lobsters (invite tree, hats)
* Sourcehut
